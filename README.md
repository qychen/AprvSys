The approval is an essential part of the most of daily work. After realizing the weakness of the traditional methods and the trend of E-commerce and electronic office, people began to try to establish a unified information platform for electronic mobile approval. This means that the approval mode will undergo significant transformation, as electronic information, rather than traditional information media, will determine the approval decision. Research and development are also shifting their focus to how to rational and effective use of electronic information in this important way, to optimize the traditional and important step of approval.

Mobile approval subsystem designing based in the ERP system is under this thesis attempts. Mobile approval has not yet been popular, but its concept and design is gradually attracting more attention, indicating that in the near future, such systems will increasingly become the focus of attention of the mainly ERP development. The system is developed under C/S structure, and it can be divided into three parts as: the server end, the client end and the communication end. The system manages to functions including achieving user information, contract management, communications and data transport, etc. The thesis presents the entire system functions as well as the key issues during designing and implementation by integrating text, legends, and snippets methods together. It also describes every important detail, and will show examples of demo testing of the system.
